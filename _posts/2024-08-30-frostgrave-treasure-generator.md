## About

This is a small project I made awhile ago.
It is a treasure generator for the tabletop game Frostgrave.

## Why make this?

My friends and I play Frostgrave from time to time.
We enjoy making high level wizards though the Malcor ruleset.
This involves rolling many times on treasure table which can get tedious.

This simulates a variable number of rolls and accumulates the treasure.
It is perfect for creating Malcor wizards - saves a lot of time.
It can also be used for regular treasure rolls of course.

It is simple program, but I've gotten a lot of use out of it.
Oh, and as a personal preference I enjoy the neon green on black color scheme.
