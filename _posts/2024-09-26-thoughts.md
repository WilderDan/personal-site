## Update

It's been about a month since I've posted.
I recently started a new job so that's been taking up most of my time.
I'd like to make the most of my remaining free time so I've been thinking about the direction that I want to take this website.

I'm still going to keep up on it, but naturally updates will likely be more spread out.
I feel I was being a bit pedantic with it before. 
I'd like to loosen it up a bit, and make it less formal and more fun.
I am just going to focus on talking about things that interest me and explore different technologies to make "cool stuff" - whatever that may be.
I am not limiting what the scope of this site will be.
I'm the only one reading it anyway ðŸ˜œ.

## A New Direction?

I am currently exploring game development.
I plan to recreate some simple classic games first to get a feel for the game engine(s) before progressing to designing and creating something more original and ambitious.
I think it's important to adequately finish some projects first. 

I am not entirely new to game development.
I've explored it in the past, and made a few games before such as MineSweeper and Pong clones.
I suppose I stopped because I wanted to practice what I thought would be more employable skills.
Well I've got job now so let's have some fun instead and make some games! ðŸŽ®
