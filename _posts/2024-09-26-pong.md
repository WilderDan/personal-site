## About

It's Pong. 
There's really not much to say.

I made this project awhile ago using Godot 3.
I did add the subdomain "pong" recently though to host it on WilderDan.com.

I wanted to start and complete a simple game before moving onto something more complicated.
Get some momentum going you know! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

There are 4 modes:

1. Practice - ball always returns to your side. See how high of a score you can get. The ball gets faster after each hit.
2. Player vs Player: One side uses WASD, the other keyboard. It's cramped I know.
3. Player vs Computer: A classic story.
4. Computer vs Computer - watch them battle it out. Both use the same AI. Who will win!? The drama is intense.
