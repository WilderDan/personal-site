# Personal Site

My [website](https://www.wilderdan.com/).

Theme taken from [{ Personal }](https://github.com/le4ker/personal-jekyll-theme).

## How to run locally

Using ruby 3.2.2

```shell
bundle install
```
Serving the website:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --livereload
```

## Note to self

For each project I plan to link to a blog post. The link to the post includes the post category. Thus, changing a post's categories may need to update this link.
