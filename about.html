<h2>About</h2>
My name is Dan Wilder. 
This website is a blog about my personal interests.
I plan to focus on mathematics and software projects that I've worked on.
However, it is likely that some other interests will come up.
Really, I'm just looking for a fun project to keep me entertained.

I used [{ Personal }](https://github.com/le4ker/personal-jekyll-theme) as a base for this website.
