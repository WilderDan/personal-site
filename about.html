<h2>About</h2>
My name is Dan Wilder. 
I made this website as a passion project. 
I blog about my interests, focusing mostly on STEM topics.
I discuss projects that I've worked on, describing what I did, learned, and what problems I faced.
I provide links to those projects as well.

I enjoy learning and applying knowledge.
This website is meant to be a place to share that passion.
Thanks for checking it out.

Have a great day!
