<h2>About</h2>
My name is Dan Wilder. 
I made this website as a passion project.
I blog about my interests, and I link to projects that I've worked on.
I focus mostly on STEM topics.
However, I have many interests. 
Who knows what else may come up?

I enjoy spending my free time with the love of my life and our two dogs.
I just thought that you should know.

Thanks for reading. Have a great rest of your day!
